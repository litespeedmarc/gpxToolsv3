If you are like me & use a cheap Bryton device, you may find from time to time that Strava is unable to understand your uploads.
This takes a FIT file (located on the device), and converts it to a format that Strava understands
<form action="/api/utils/fitfix" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <p><input type="file" name="file">
  <p><button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
